## Simple JavaScript Calculator
### A simple calculator built in pure vanilla JavaScript for learning purposes.
This is a simple and small calculator project just to learn pure HTML, CSS and JS. I didn't use any 3rd party library (Neither for CSS nor for JS) or `eval()` function, I wrote everything from scratch. I didn't pursue a goal of making the code perfect as well. You can use keyboard keys(Any numeric keys and del & backspace to AC/Reset) to calculate.
